# haskell-music-demo
Small demo project that uses Euterpea to generate (kind of) "random" melodies and plays them in a duet together with non-random drums.

# Prerequisites
- Haskell Tool Stack installed

# Build and Run
1. Clone repos
2. Run `stack run` in the project dir
3. Enjoy dat freaky-ish, computer generated music

Feel free to fork and make your own melodies, duets, loops and tracks.
