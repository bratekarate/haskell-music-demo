# haskell-music-demo
Small demo project that uses Euterpea to generate (kind of) "random" melodies and plays them in a duet together with non-random drums.

## Prerequisites
- Haskell Tool Stack installed
- On Linux or Mac, a MIDI-Synthesizer must be installed to generate sounds. Follow [this manual](http://www.euterpea.com/midi-on-linux).

## Build and Run
1. Clone repos
2. Run `stack run` in the project dir
3. Enjoy dat freaky-ish, computer-generated music

Feel free to fork and create your own melodies, duets, loops and tracks.
